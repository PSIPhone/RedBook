				<p>We are a small team right now, and any decision we take everyday heavily depends on each and every team member working on great products. Sometimes, we take decisions very quickly, and if things are going in wrong direction, we turn back that decision as quickly as possible. While making such rapid decisions, we expect everyone to be present at the office participating in all the conversations that are going on. Because of this, we've put a lot of time and money in designing our office space, and strategically placing it in a place that's easily accessible to the team members.</p>
				<p>We expect the full-time team members to be at the office anywhere between 45 to 55 hours a week, and to be very punctual for team meetings. We also expect the full-time team members to be prepared for such meetings, and actively contribute to the topic that's being discussed. Every team member is an important contributor to the decisions we make and the path the product takes over the course of time. If someone has a consideration which requires them to be out of the office, they should get approval from the founding team as far in advance as possible.</p>
				<p>We are growing at a slow and steady pace, and we are very keen in hiring the best people on the planet. We hope to add more flexibility in working hours and such as we grow, but at this point of time, having face-to-face interactions at our office is very critical. The office is available for you to use 24x7.</p>
