### Acknowledgement of Receipt of Employee RedBook

I hereby acknowledge that I have received the Skcript Employee RedBook and I confirm that I have read all the documents in the RedBook to understand its provisions. I further understand that I can ask any clarification about any provisions I have to the founders of the company.

I further understand that the founders of Skcript may at any time modify, rescind, or revise any policy, benefit, or practice described in the RedBook, and the same will be intimated to the entire company via email.

I understand and agree that my employment with Skcript is at-will and can be terminated by either me or the company without cause with one month notice, and that nothing in the RedBook should be interpreted to the contrary. This is the entire agreement between me and Skcript on this subject; it supersedes any prior inconsistent representations or agreements and may only be modified in a writing signed by me and the CEO.

I acknowledge that it is my responsibility to read and become familiar with the contents of the RedBook.
