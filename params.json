{"name":"RedBook","tagline":"The secret handbook for Skcript.","body":"# RedBook\r\n\r\nEveryday, we work on ideas that are highly complex and solve problems that are still a challenge to the entire industry. To do that kind of work, we understand the importance of having an open, inclusive and collaborative culture. Over the past few months, we’ve invested a lot of time in exploring and experimenting different areas where we could innovate in terms of creating the most effective company culture. \r\n\r\nWhile these things sounds good on paper, it is far more difficult to implement, and adopt a new cultural idea in the company. But for the ones who’re joining our company, we use something called the RedBook, which gives them a glimpse of what they can expect and how the company works. \r\n\r\nWe started working on the #OpenCulture project that encourages people to open-source their company culture to create one super huge book of culture to help other startups.\r\n\r\nWe are open-sourcing our culture documents and the contents of our RedBook in this repository. We are looking to open source the following documents:\r\n\r\n- Our Values\r\n- Mission Statement\r\n- Employment Policy\r\n- Holiday/Leave Policy\r\n- Support for Contribution\r\n- Sabbatical Policy\r\n- Code of Conduct\r\n- Employee Privacy\r\n- Welcome Letter\r\n- Employee Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreement\r\n- Internal Hierarchy\r\n\r\nWe will constantly approve pull requests and contributions to this repository. We believe that its very important to make the startups a better place, before we could make the world a better place.\r\n\r\n— [Karthik K](https://twitter.com/imkarthikk)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Contents\r\n\r\n**Generic:**\r\n\r\n- [Values](Values.md)\r\n- [Mission Statement](Mission Statement.md)\r\n\r\n**Policies**\r\n\r\n- [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/skcript/RedBook/blob/master/Policies/Code%20of%20Conduct.md)\r\n- [Employee Privacy](https://github.com/skcript/RedBook/blob/master/Policies/Employee%20Privacy.md)\r\n- [Employment Policy](https://github.com/skcript/RedBook/blob/master/Policies/Employment%20Policy.md)\r\n- [Workplace Policy](https://github.com/skcript/RedBook/blob/master/Policies/Workplace%20Policy.md)\r\n\r\n**Perks**\r\n\r\n- [Holidays](https://github.com/skcript/RedBook/blob/master/Perks/Holidays.md)\r\n- [Insurance](https://github.com/skcript/RedBook/blob/master/Perks/Insurance.md)\r\n- [Sabbatical](https://github.com/skcript/RedBook/blob/master/Perks/Sabbatical.md)\r\n- [Support for Contribution](https://github.com/skcript/RedBook/blob/master/Perks/Support%20for%20Contribution.md)\r\n- [Vacations and Leaves](https://github.com/skcript/RedBook/blob/master/Perks/Vacations%20and%20Leaves.md)\r\n\r\n**Letters & Documents**\r\n\r\n- [Acknowledgement of Receipt](https://github.com/skcript/RedBook/blob/master/Letters%20%26%20Documents/Acknowledgment%20of%20Receipt.md)\r\n- [Employee Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreement](https://github.com/skcript/RedBook/blob/master/Letters%20%26%20Documents/EPIIAA.md)\r\n- [Hello Engineer](https://github.com/skcript/RedBook/blob/master/Letters%20%26%20Documents/Hello%20Engineer.md)\r\n- [Welcome One Pager](https://github.com/skcript/RedBook/blob/master/Letters%20%26%20Documents/Welcome%20One%20Pager.md)\r\n\r\n**Internal**\r\n\r\n- [Hierarchy](https://github.com/skcript/RedBook/blob/master/Internal/Hierarchy.md)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\nWe encourage as many people as possible to contribute to this repository to create a better startup ecosystem before we could change the world.
